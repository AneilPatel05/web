# Posting Guidelines

Steemhunt is a ranking community run by early-adopters who hunt "effortlessly cool products." Please follow these guidelines when making a post. If your post fails to follow the guidelines, it may be excluded from the ranking.

---

## 1. Post a "Product," not a "Business."
A business is larger and more vague than a product. For example, you may post a new Samsung Galaxy S9 phone - this is a product. You can’t post "Samsung" itself - this is a business. Also, you can’t post a local product. Steemhunt is a global community, so you should bring something that everyone can enjoy.

## 2. Types of Products to Post
Steemhunt generally covers unique IT or hardware products, including:
* Web services
* Mobile apps
* Games
* API, IT solutions, bots, open sources or other types of software
* Tech gadgets
* Unique items

## 3. Language - English Only
Steemhunt runs a single ranking board globally, so please post and comment in English.

## 4. Product Link
All posts must have a valid website. You can only provide an official website of the product, app download link, or e-commerce site where users can make purchases. The following examples WILL NOT be accepted:
* Newspaper articles
* Listicles (like '00 cool inventions …')
* Blog posts (unless it’s a launching post.)
* Social media posts such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, or Instagram

## 5. Plagiarism and Copyright
Write a sentence and description with your own words. Do not copy and paste from the product’s website or other sites. You can however quote some content from a site, but you must use quotes and cite the source properly.

## 6. Do Not Use Upvoting Bot
Using an upvoting bot service may disrupt our daily ranking. This is a product community where "people" actually see the product you’ve hunted, and upvote the products they think are cool.

## 7. Post "New" Products
Steemhunt is about cool "new" products. Please make sure that your hunt is about something that’s recently introduced. If the product is not new, there must be strong reason to post. For example, the product must be substantially updated or upgraded in a way that has a positive effect on users. Or, it must be a product that not many people have observed and may be interesting to discover.
